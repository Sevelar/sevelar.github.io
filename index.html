                    DisViewer is a reloaded version of its predecessor - Discord Previewer. Instead of using the pure JavaScript, DisViewer is being made with a help of React.js. Made from scratch, featuring completely refreshed CSS and design! Currently in development.

                <b>I am just a hobbyist coder, mainly focused around JavaScript and C#.</b> I am a big fan of Discord and I use it frequently. Hours put in writing stories with my friends resulted in me needing something better than built-in markdown syntax preview in Discord. That's how Discord Previewer was born - a simple application made in Electron, which helped me to easy import text already containing Markdown syntaxes and preview it real-time, along with editing the content and later exporting it as ready-to-paste text. After finishing the first versions of my application, I immediately found JS as my new favorite programming language. I decided to study it further, also learning both HTML and CSS in the process.
